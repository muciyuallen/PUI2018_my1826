CLARITY: The plot is easy to read. It is very clear. 
The quantities is not being visualized ambiguous. 
However, there are lots of circles that are overlap with each other, which makes it little hard to distinguish every single circle.

ESTHETIC: The plot's esthetic is functional, it has kind of a comic book vibe which I think is refreshing. 
It has two different colors to represents two diffenrent category. All the colors are distinguishable. 
The graphical elements are used appropriate to represent the quantities being visualized. 

HONESTY: The plot is honestly reproducing the data.

All in all, Muci did a really good job on the visualization. 
What I would change is the scale of the plot. 
Since all the circles are gathered in the middle of the plot, I would probably zoom in that area so that we can see the information more clear.
