# Rreview for HW8 plot

- Regarding the clarity, the graph is not clear in presenting the data. The idea of using the radius of a circle to represent the magnitude of the data does not clearly represent the data since there is no information stating the equivalency of each radius or a scale ruler for example. Moreover, a lot of the data are not clearly visible, in Manhattan for example, due to the overlapping of different circles.

- Regarding the esthetic, the colors chosen are nice and clear. Representing the map in black and white was helpful in adding more focus to the data represented rather than the background map itself.

- Regarding the honesty, the plot was honest in representing the data without hidding any data. However, the plot was ambiguous in presenting the data quantatively.

# Suggested Improvements

- A scale ruler to signify the magnitude of the data.
- Focusing on a smaller area, a specific borough for example, would be a better to clarify the data regarding each borough.
- Adding a legend would be make it easier to represent the different colors in the graph in addition to the caption.
